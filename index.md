# Jimmy Jin

I'm a data scientist who prefers simple, transparent methods. I also enjoy writing production code. Big fan of the t-test, SQL and Spark. Read more about my experiences on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmy-jin-5325ab6/).

My general philosophy towards data science is that simple methods are usually sufficient. If they're not, then it's usually because the data are messed up, and I often prefer fixing the underlying cause of messy data rather than reaching for an advanced technique to paper over the fundamental issues. I enjoy data engineering and am willing to get my hands dirty to build a clean pipeline.

I care a lot about having a positive impact on society and am  **always on the lookout for opportunities with non-profits or local government agencies**. If you know of any interesting openings, please reach out.

- I'm currently a staff data scientist at LaunchDarkly, helping to build out their experimentation product.

- I did a brief stint on the Growth team at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/).

- Spent 5 years at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) prior to that where I worked on many different teams and projects, from card payment optimization, FX observability, dashboard multi-armed bandit optimization, and funnel analysis and experimentation on [Link](https://link.com/).
    
- Once upon a time I was a student at UNC-Chapel Hill where I worked on probability and networks with  [Shankar Bhamidi](http://www.unc.edu/~bhamidi/)  and  [Andrew Nobel](http://www.unc.edu/~nobel/). Here's my  [thesis](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:d489c99f-47af-450b-b96b-e86875fdce1e)
    
## Miscellany

Sometimes I come across cute problems that I think about and feel are worth writing up:

-   The size of the Codenames word pool ([link](https://yichijin.github.io/files/codenames.pdf))
    
-   The distribution of unpecked chicks ([link](https://yichijin.github.io/files/unpecked.pdf))
    
-   Elchanan Mossel's dice problem ([link](https://yichijin.github.io/files/elchanan.pdf))
