# Jimmy Jin

You found me. I'm a data scientist who prefers simple, transparent methods. I also enjoy writing production code. Big fan of the t-test, SQL and Spark.

I care a lot about having a positive impact on society and am  **always on the lookout for opportunities with non-profits or local government agencies**. If you know of any interesting openings, please reach out.

- I'm currently at  [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
    
- Once upon a time I was a student at UNC-Chapel Hill where I worked on probability and networks with  [Shankar Bhamidi](http://www.unc.edu/~bhamidi/)  and  [Andrew Nobel](http://www.unc.edu/~nobel/). Here's my  [thesis](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:d489c99f-47af-450b-b96b-e86875fdce1e)
    
## Miscellany

Sometimes I come across cute problems that I think about and feel are worth writing up:

-   The size of the Codenames word pool ([link](https://yichijin.github.io/files/codenames.pdf))
    
-   The distribution of unpecked chicks ([link](https://yichijin.github.io/files/unpecked.pdf))
    
-   Elchanan Mossel's dice problem ([link](https://yichijin.github.io/files/elchanan.pdf))
